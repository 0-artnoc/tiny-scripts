If you’re opening an issue to report `Error creating pull request: Unprocessable Entity (HTTP 422)` in `cask-repair`, don’t.

As I’ve mentioned on several occasions, I’m pretty tired of debugging that specific issue. It is `hub`-related (search for the error on Google) and generally happens with certain git configs. I can’t test them all. You can see from the other issues (e.g. [#20](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/tiny-scripts/issues/20)) how much time I’ve already wasted on it.

Unfortunately, I won’t keep shooting in the dark. I’m happy to take a pull request that squashes the problem for good, but don’t intend to waste much longer trying to diagnose it. It only affects a small set of users and is no longer worth the commitment and frustration.

If you still open the issue for that problem without further information, it’ll be closed without review.

If reporting any other issue, delete this template and go ahead.

Thank you.
